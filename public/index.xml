      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m really only just beginning my delving into being a developer1, I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet attended any developer conferences. That changed today. I caught most of the live presentations at Jamstack Conf Virtual 2020 and watched recordings of the ones I missed.
Jamstack and event resources Much of the detail was over my head in the presentations but I did get the gist of things at a higher level. And I&amp;rsquo;m really impressed by the Jamstack projects and approaches shown off.</description>

      <description>It works! This post suggests that I correctly have my Hugo-rendered site up and running. Check the link for more information on the Hugo open-source software, but essentially, it takes Markdown content and renders static site pages for much faster delivery than a traditional CMS with a database, such as Wordpress.
For now, I have the content being hosted for free on Netlify which does offer a reasonable amount of hosting features at no cost.</description>
