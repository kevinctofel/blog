Late last month, I said I'd be looking into WSL, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which is still a work in progress and available for Windows 10. 

If you're not familiar with WSL, it's an easy way to run just about any Linux distro in a VM within Windows. [Microsoft explains it better than I can](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/).

The first version was a little slow due to the architecture, but now Microsoft has WSL2, which slips a very small but capable Linux kernel in the middle of the architecture, like so:

This allows Windows 10 users to use Windows apps that interact quickly with Linux apps. For example, I installed and configured WSL2 and then grabbed Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store. (YES, the Microsoft Store is where you get the distros!)

I upgrade Ubuntu packages as needed and installed Node.js and Gatsby, which is what I'm using to experiment with an open source blog platform that generates super fast static sites: [More info here on what I'm doing](https://www.kctofel.com/post/2020-06-18-the-great-gatsby-vs-hugo-for-static-site-generation/).

I already had VSCode installed on the Windows side, by the way. And that's important. Here's why, in a general sense, per Microsoft:

> WSL 2 includes a huge architecture change using virtualization technology, and we are still working on improving the networking support. Since WSL 2 now runs in a virtual machine, you will need to use that VM’s IP address to access Linux networking applications from Windows, and vice versa you will need the Windows host’s IP address to access Windows networking applications from Linux

> What this effectively means is that Windows can access the Linux filesystem through WSL2. And that matters because it's how I made this quick and dirty "Hello world" page / post using Node.js and Gatsby in Linux.

> You can see that my blog page is running in Chrome within Windows 10. But the HTML was generated by Node.js and Gatsby in Ubuntu, as shown in VSCode. Here's the thing: VSCode is running in Windows but if you look at the bottom right of it, you can see that it's accessing the Linux filesystem.

> This approach is similar to what I've been using on a Chromebook for nearly two years. Google debuted "Project Crostini" which creates a Linux container within a virtual machine on Chrome OS. WSL2 is a similar approach but with one current downside: You can't run Linux GUI apps with it yet. Microsoft is working on that. I can do that with my Chromebook so I just run VSCode for Linux on it to accomplish the same thing.

> The short answer is probably, depending on if there are Linux versions of the tools, IDEs and such that you'll need for your specific program. It works fine for mine.
