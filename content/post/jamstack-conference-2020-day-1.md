Since I'm really only just beginning my delving into being a developer[^1], I haven't yet attended any developer conferences. That changed today. I caught most of the live presentations at [Jamstack Conf Virtual 2020](https://jamstackconf.com/) and watched recordings of the ones I missed. 

##### Jamstack and event resources #####

Much of the detail was over my head in the presentations but I did get the gist of things at a higher level. And I'm really impressed by the Jamstack projects and approaches shown off. You can learn more about the Jamstack at <https://www.Jamstack.org> and view the recorded conference sessions on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9yrrQBBKos&list=PL58Wk5g77lF8jzqp_1cViDf-WilJsAvqT).

I'm looking forward to the second day, which is tomorrow, but again, I'm a n00b, so I'm just trying to get a feel for the overall vision. If I can pick up any details of specific patterns or implementations, that's a bonus!

[^1]: Although I've been using computers and tinkering with code since the late 1970's, I don't have any formal education in software development. I started to pursue a [10-class Software Engineering certificate at my local community college](https://www.mc3.edu/degrees-and-programs/programs/engineering-and-technology/software-engineering) in the fall of 2018 and I've completed 6 classes.
