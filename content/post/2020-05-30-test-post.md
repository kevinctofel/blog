#### Testing the Netlify CMS

Just added it to my repo and configured it.

If this post appears on the public page, that means it's working! :)

Here are the [technical details of the Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/).

The beauty of this, aside from not writing posts in Visual Code or a text editor, is that I don't even have to deal with GitHub: Publishing a post handles *all* the staging, commits, and pushing to the GitHub repo where this blog content lives.
